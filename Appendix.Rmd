Appendix:
  
  Taking a quick look at these data, after removing "FUNZONE" and VMI, to check that these have been excluded.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check droped records
Overages2 %>% group_by(BRD_DIV_DESC) %>% 
  summarise("Units" = sum(INV_RCPT_QTY, na.rm=TRUE))%>% 
  as.data.frame()%>%
  knitr::kable()
Overages2 %>% group_by(Program_Type) %>% 
  summarise("Units" = sum(INV_RCPT_QTY, na.rm=TRUE))%>% 
  as.data.frame()%>%
  knitr::kable()
```

And checking that we have only **OLD NAVY** and also the proper unit count.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Overages2 %>% 
  group_by(BRD_NM) %>% 
  summarise("Units" = sum(INV_RCPT_QTY, na.rm=TRUE))%>% 
  as.data.frame()%>%
  knitr::kable()

```
